# Bubble Sort Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm, a straightforward sorting technique suitable for educational purposes and small datasets.

## Overview
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm with the following key characteristics:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Best Case: O(n)
  - Average Case: O(n^2)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
- **Algorithm Type:** Comparison-based, stable

## Features
- Implemented in **C++**.
- Supports sorting arrays/lists of integers, floats, or other comparable data types.

## File Structure
- `BubbleSort.cpp`: Contains the implementation of Bubble Sort.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bubble-sort.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd bubble-sort
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o bubble_sort BubbleSort.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./bubble_sort
   ```

## Algorithm Steps
1. Traverse the array from start to end.
2. Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. Repeat the process for all elements until the array is sorted.
4. After each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.

## Example Input and Output
### Input
```plaintext
Array: [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
```
### Output
```plaintext
Sorted Array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
```
